Currently, there are limited client libraries available for Liftbridge.
However, Liftbridge uses gRPC for its client API, so low-level client libraries
can be generated quite easily using the [Liftbridge protobuf
definitions](https://github.com/liftbridge-io/liftbridge-api). See the [client
implementation guidance](client_implementation.md) documentation for help on
implementing a Liftbridge client library.

Available client libraries are listed below. Libraries with an asterisk are
official clients.

## Go
